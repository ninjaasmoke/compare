# compare

a small quest to compare simple, similar programs in different languages; check which is the fastest.

## what is this?
i am trying to learn RUST and GO, so why not compare them with the languages i already kinda know?

which is why, i want to try to implement the same program in each language to the best i can and compare their execution times with each other

## contribution
if anyone finds this cool, feel free to clone, contribute, share, etc

### steps to conrtibute:

* clone this repo
* change the code, make it better (or worse)
* create PR

## disclaimer
obviously each language has it's own perks & caveats, i just want to see them fight against each other
