# Quick Sort

comparing the speed of various programming languages to sort a large array using quicksort

the steps in each program is:

1. Read the numbers from a file called "data.txt" which contains numbers separated by ","
2. Sort the numbers
3. Write the sorted array back to a file "output.txt"

## How to run?

bash run.sh
```

### Disclaimer
~~`data.txt` was too large to push via git. so i pushed a much smaller file `data_small.txt`.~~

~~`data.txt` is \~5mb.~~

added a new `generate_random.py`, so go ahead and generate whatever.
